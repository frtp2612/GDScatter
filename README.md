# What can scatter do?
- [x] You can place large amounts of objects without major losses in performance.
- [x] You can tweak the radius of the drawing brush to be able to draw on large or small areas by using the corresponding slider on the interface, or you can use W and S to respectively
increment or decrement the radius of the brush.
- [x] You can switch the drawing mode from Edit to Delete and viceversa. This can be done by pressing Q on your keyboard. In edit mode the brush area will glow blue,
while in delete mode it will glow red.
A switch on the interface is not present yet, but might be added in the next release.
- [x] You can change the brush hardness. This means you can reduce the number of instances drawn all the way to 1/10 of the instances displayed by the brush.
- [x] You can change how many mesh instances are placed. This is tweakable through the corresponding slider and the changes will be visible on the brush.

# What will scatter be able to do in the future?
- [ ] Add new meshes in the tool directly from the sidebar provided with the tool.(It is usable but it is still a WIP)
- [ ] TBD...
